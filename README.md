# Super Leaper Blocks!

## Iterations

I started by creating the game base, where the players control blocks and can move them with wasd and jikl. With S and K being jump buttons instead of moving backwards buttons. Once I got the base working I began my iterations.

Iteration 1: Obstacles
I added some level of skill through two things. I made the box to hit hit when jumping over someone smaller and I added some obstacles to the arena. These things make it so the battle isn't just jumping back and forth but that they have to plan and use their 
environment to their advantage.

Iteration 2: Timer
I decided to add a timer that goes down while you play the game, once it's done the game ends. This creates a goal because now you have to get the most points by the end of the timer and you only have so many seconds to do it.

Iteration 3: UI
To create feedback for the player I added a UI that shows the timer and the scores. This creates a way for the player to track how well they are doing and helps them see how long they have left to win.

Iteration 4: Powerup
I added one last small addition which is a speed boost. When the player hits the powerup they get their speed doubled. This creates another level of skill and chance, the powerup speed isn't easy to control and it's random who will get it.
